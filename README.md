# url-csv2text
This PowerShell script takes a csv file that contains line separated URLs which can include valid and invalid URLs as well as URLs that include and don't include the "www" prefix as well as subpages, "www.example.com/something/else" and sanitizes them to just be the main url "example.com". It also removes duplicate results. Finally it tests each URL and includes the valid URLs in one txt output file and the invalid URLs in another txt output file. A great feature of this  PowerShell script is that it processes testing the URLs to see which are valid and which are invalid in parallel groups (slices), thus greatly speeding up the script.
